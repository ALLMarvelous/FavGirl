# FavGirl
A cosmetic Muse Dash mod allowing you to select characters and abilities separately.  
## Features
This mod adds a heart button next to characters and elfins in the selection menus, allowing you to choose the appearance of your character separate from the ability of your character.
## Limitations
- Does not support Neon Egg elfin
- Does not support Kagamine Rin & Len character
## Notes
I plan on getting around to rewriting FavGirl entirely, adding support for Kagamine Rin & Len and Neon Egg in the process. It might take a significant amount of time so I apologize if not being able to play as the new character disappoints some people, but they are the first character to be *two* characters, so there is some complication that comes with that.
